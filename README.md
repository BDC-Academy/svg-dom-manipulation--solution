# SVG DOM manipulation

## Prerequisites

Basic understanding of how to use the SVG basic shapes, including circle, rect, line, polyline, polygon and path.

Good understanding of how to use JavaScript to select and manipulate DOM elements.

## Essentials

- Repository from Github (Classroom) **svg-dom-manipulation**

## Starting point

Clean HTML file index.html + predefined JavaScript files basic-shapes.js, bubbles.js and star.js

## Preparation

Trainer:

- Give everyone access tot the repository via GitHub classroom
- Explain what DOM manipulation in JavaScript entails and how to use it with SVG

Participant:

- Download repository
- Read README.MD
- Study the text from the provided links below if necessary

## Learning objective

Learning to manipulate the DOM to create SVG shapes, change them dynamically and remove them from the DOM again.

## Description

A webpage is defined by and made up of the elements in the Document Object Model or the DOM. After a webpage is loaded, the DOM can be manipulated by means JavaScript.

Inline SVG elements are also part of the DOM and can thus be manipulated with JavaScript the same way HTML elements can, including: the element attributes, inline CSS style, event handling and DOM features that are unique to SVG.

We will first recreate a couple of our basic shapes we did in the last assignment, but we will create them with JavaScript and maybe even change them on user event.

After that we will create our very own game in SVG, which pops up different sized bubbles you need to click to score points.

Lastly we will take a look at our star again but draw it perfectly and open with JavaScript.

## Result

After the assignment you will have used JavaScript to create multiple SVG graphics and shapes, change them after an event occurs and remove them again when clicked.

## Libraries

None, HTML natively supports SVG
