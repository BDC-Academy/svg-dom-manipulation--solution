      <!-- TODO: 1 Dynamically adding svg elements to the DOM with JavaScript
      We added elements and attributes to the DOM manually, creating static SVG visualizations.
      If we want to do this dynamically, 
      because we need to calculate stuff based on data or change the visualization when the user interacts with it,
      we use JavaScript to manipulate the DOM just like you would/could with HTML.
      Later on D3.js and React.js will do this for you, but let's try it ourselfs first.
      An example of adding a square polygon shape can be found in the js/basic-shapes.js file. 
      Study it and use the empty functions to recreate the basic shapes from before:
        1. Add a triangle to the basic-shapes svg element
        2. Add a circle to the basic-shapes svg element
        3. Uncomment the HTML button below and use the handler function in basic-shapes.js to change the colors of the shapes every time the button is clicked

    <button id="change-colors" onclick="handleChangeColorsClick()">Change colors</button>

    <!-- TODO: 2 Listening to SVG events
      Event listeners on SVG elements work kind of the same as in HTML. 
      Elements have for example a mouseenter and mouseout events which you can bind to a handler function.
      Just like in HTML, we use the JavaScript addEventListener function to bind element events to handler functions.

        - 1. Add mouse event listeners to the triangle in the createSVGTriangle function. The triangle should start rotating when the mouse enters the triangle and stop rotating it goes out again
        - EXTRA: Make it so it stops at the current position instead of resetting when you mouseout. Tip: CSS property animation-play-state

      Note: the stacking order of the elements is important when hovering

    <svg id="bubbles" width="400" height="400">
    <!--TODO: 3 catching bubbles
      Let's combine what we have learned and create a little game that goes as follows:
      At random interval, position and size blue bubbles pop-up and disappear again. 
      When you click a blue bubble it turns red and won't disappear anymore unless you click it again.
      So we are adding elements, removing element and handling click events in this assignment.
        - Open up js/bubbles.js and study the code a bit
        1. Finish the code that creates a bubble in the createBubble function and see if you can get one on screen 
        2. Make the bubble respond to the click correctly, changing it's color to red.
        3. Randomly add bubbles using an interval
        4. Remove the bubbles after a random number if milliseconds using a timeout inside the interval

        - EXTRA: make the bubbles animate in smoothly using keyframes and transform scale
        - EXTRA: add the radius of the bubble as text inside the circle. 
          This could represent a score of somekind, for example to catch as many bubbles as possible but keep the total score as low as possible
        - EXTRA: Also add a square green bubble. If you click it when it's green, you win an the game stops! Don't make it to easy to win though ;)
      
      Note: removing an element can be done by the parent element or by the element itself
      Note2: you can't set the text element content with setAttribute

    <svg id="star" width="400" height="400">
      <!-- TODO: Extra drawing an open star by calculating angles and sides
    if we wanted to make an open star without the inside stroke lines we could draw the outer lines by trying to guess the points you need, 
    but this is really tedious and nearly impossible to get right.
    The best way to draw a star with only the outerside lines, is to calculate the points and angles and use JavaScript to set the DOM elements and attributes.
    Open up the star.js file and study the stolen code ;) 
    Try and mess around with the radius and starpoints a bit to see what happens.
